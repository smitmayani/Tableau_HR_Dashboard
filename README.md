# Tableau_HR_Dashboard

This project features a comprehensive and interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built with Tableau. Using the well-known IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, this dashboard provides critical insights into workforce trends to help HR leaders make strategic, data-driven decisions.

The primary goal of this dashboard is to address key business challenges such as high employee attrition, identifying diversity and performance gaps, and understanding the factors that influence employee satisfaction and retention.

# üìà Key Features & Analysis
The dashboard is designed to provide a multi-faceted view of the organization's workforce health, focusing on four key areas:

**Attrition Analysis**: Identifies the primary drivers of employee attrition. The analysis highlights high-risk job roles and departments and quantifies the impact of factors like overtime on employee turnover.

**Demographic Profiling**: Visualizes the age and gender distribution of the workforce and analyzes how these demographic factors correlate with attrition rates, revealing which groups are most at risk of leaving.

**Performance & Diversity**: Assesses performance ratings across different departments and genders. This helps in identifying potential performance gaps or unconscious biases in performance evaluation.

**Compensation & Satisfaction**: Explores the complex relationship between monthly income, job satisfaction, and an employee's decision to stay with or leave the company.

# üìä Dashboard Components

The single-page dashboard is structured to tell a clear data story and includes the following visualizations:

**Executive KPI Banner**: At-a-glance metrics for the most critical numbers:

Total Employees

Overall Attrition Rate (%)

Average Monthly Income

Average Job Satisfaction

Attrition by Job Role & Overtime (Heatmap): A color-coded table that instantly highlights the job roles with the highest attrition rates, particularly when employees work overtime. It also includes the total number of employees in each category for context.

Attrition by Age & Gender (Histogram): A demographic breakdown showing the distribution of attrition across different age groups for both male and female employees.

Income vs. Job Satisfaction (Scatter Plot): An individual-level plot that visualizes the relationship between compensation and satisfaction, with points colored by attrition status to reveal patterns among leavers.

Performance & Diversity Gaps (100% Stacked Bar Chart): A proportional view of performance ratings by gender across different departments, allowing for a fair and direct comparison of performance distributions.

Attrition by Department & Job Role (Bar Chart): A supplementary chart providing a clear view of attrition rates for specific job roles within each department.
